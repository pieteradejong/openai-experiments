# OpenAI Experiments
[![pytest](https://github.com/pieteradejong/openai-experiments/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/pieteradejong/openai-experiments/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Experimenting with OpenAI, as an already daily user of ChatGPT4.

Playing with different models e.g. `gpt-3.5-turbo`, backend streaming versus front end chat agent.

Will potentially plug in custom-trained on other datasets, e.g. Axios articles.
